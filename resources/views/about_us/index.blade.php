    মজার ইশকুল :: Mojar School (School of Fun) was established on January 10, 2013 with the aim of providing full free education with fun to the disadvantaged children. Starting with the slogan “Food-Education-Technology”, it has been providing free education to 1,000 underprivileged street children in the National Curriculum from pre-primary to 7th grade and another 1000 in non-formal education for almost 10 years. A total of 2,000 students are getting the opportunity to study at Mojar School.

    In cooperation with 80 officers and 5,000 registered volunteers, regular activities are going on in 8 schools, 1 residential village, and 1 training center all over the country. About 200 families have been made self-reliant through the Zakat Fund, which is ongoing. The head office is located at Banani in the capital Dhaka of Bangladesh.
    For nearly 10 years,
    Cooked food has been distributed to 500,000 hungry people which is a continuous initiative. Each month we try to distribute cooked food to 15,000-20,000 people.

    We provide general education up to the age of 18, and then arrange income-generating education through training and technical education.

    Sponsors A Child, Corporate (CSR), and Crowed Funding are the main source of funds for the children, at the same time, there are initiatives like social enterprise to ensure its own capability.
